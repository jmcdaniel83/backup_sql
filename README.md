# SQL Backup Code written in Python

Wanted to generate some code that would allow me ease of use to backup my databases for the MMO RPGs that I have running in my own docker cluster.

This allows the database to be easily backed up by creating a configuration file that contains all the necessary data needed to connect and define which database to back up.
